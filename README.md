# Low Level Learning Course 1

Goals:
1. Learn to be productive in a low level language.
2. Get comfortable with manual memory management.
3. Gain a deeper understanding of how computers work.
4. Spend 60 hours working on improving my low level understanding

Language Choice: C

I also considered Rust, Zig, C++, and Odin. But ultimately decided on C.

C has several advantages:
- learning C will translate to all these other languages since they are heavily C inspired
- these languages are often designed around the pitfalls of C, knowing those pitfalls will make these languages make more sense
- learning C will help me read, learn from, and contribute to existing codebases like neovim, postgres, and linux.
- C forces you to minimize abstraction, focus on what the computer is doing.
- C's minimal std library forces you to reimplement basic data structures, string handling, etc, giving me a deeper low level understanding
- C is fun and retro!

Projects:

1. Implement common data structures in C
    - stack
    - list
    - linked list
    - hashmap

2. ARM Assembly 
    - Fibonacci sequence generator
    - List sorter
    - Hash function

3. ARM Emulator
    - Emulate a subset of ARM assembly using C
    - Rewrite assembly programs from above using emulator

4. Simple interpreted language
5. Web server
6. database
